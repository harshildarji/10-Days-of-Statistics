Link to task: [Pearson Correlation Coefficient II](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-7/problem)

`y on x := 3x + 4y + 8 = 0`

`x on y := 4x + 3y + 8 = 0`

- Calculate the slope:

`y = -2 + (-3/4) * x`

`x = -7/4 + (-3/4) * y`

- So, Slope 1 and Slope 2  = **`-3/4`**

- In this case, both the slope are same, and also the numerator will also be the same, so our answer will be **`-3/4`**.
