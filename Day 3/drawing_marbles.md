Link to task: [Drawing Marbles](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-6/problem)

### Task:
A bag contains **3** red marbles and **4** blue marbles. Then, **2** marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

### Solution:

Total marbles in bag: `3 Red + 4 Blue` = **7**

First marble drawn is **Red**. Now, we have only **6** marbles remaining to choose our second marble from.

- Total cases: **_`C(6, 1)`_** = **6**
- Favourable cases:
  
  Since we want our second marble to be **Blue**, we have only **4** marbles to choose from.
  
  Therefore, total favourable cases: **_`C(4, 1)`_** = **4**
  
Probability that the second marble is blue: **_`C(4, 1) / C(6, 1)`_** = **`4 / 6`** = **`2/3`**
