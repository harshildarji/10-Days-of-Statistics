### Task:
In a single toss of **2** fair (_evenly-weighted_) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most **9**.

### Solution:

- Sample space (Ω): `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} * {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
- Event A := "Sum of both dice is **greater** than 9" = `{(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)}`
- Event B := "Sum of both dice is **at most** than 9", therfore `|B| = |Ω| - |A|` = `36 - 6` = **30**
- P(B) = `|B| / |Ω|` = `30 / 36` = `5 / 6`

Probabilty that the sum of both dice will be at most **9** is **`5/6`**.
